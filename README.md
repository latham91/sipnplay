# Sip & Play - Track 1 - Codedex Summer Hackathon 2024

## Team Members
- **Dut**: Front-end Developer, UI/UX Developer
- **Aaron**: Full-stack Developer, Backend and Databases

## Problem Statement
The task was to revamp the Sip & Play website, improving the UI and UX while incorporating 3D elements into the menu within a 24-hour sprint.

## Tech Stack
- Next.js
- TailwindCSS
- NeonDB
- Prisma ORM
- Shadcn-UI
- Three.js

## Features
- **Full Website Redesign**: Enhanced the overall look and feel of the website.
- **3D Models on Menu Page**: Added interactive 3D elements to the menu as requested.
- **Random Prize-Wheel**: A fun feature to help users choose a random board game to play.
- **Functional CMS/Admin Panel**: Allows staff to add and delete new menu items, events, and board games, with updates reflected in real-time on the front end.

## Challenges
- **Time Constraint**: Completing the project within a 24-hour period was demanding.
- **Unfamiliarity with Three.js**: Significant time was spent learning and implementing Three.js for the 3D elements.
